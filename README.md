# quick-steps
A Bash menu system for quick step/ help viewing e.g. you have lengthy procedure documentation which you consolidate down to quick step guide text files (once your comfortable with the procedure) which you can call from within your shell.

1 - The .txt files need to be stored within a qs-docs/ sub folder.
2 - The first line of each qs doc text file is used as the menu item so keep them short but descriptive.
3 - You can use the .txt file name to control the ordering of the menu if required.
